Arithmetic Operations in java:
    Modulus operator/remainder (%):
    When we use the int data type we can use this operator to get the remainder part. For example
    if we take the remainder of 11 by 5 we will get 1. We can use this operator to find out if
    a number is multiple of another number if a number is even or odd number etc.
String concatenation:
    1)String concatenation allows us to attach two Strings or one String with any other data type.
    String result="Messi"+10=> Messi10
    The result will always be a type of String and those two data types will be combined.
    2) Normally java executes the code from top to bottom and from left to right however this
    can be different if we use parenthesis, or we are doing pure math calculations for example
    multiplication has precedence over addition and subtraction (BODMAS) rules.
    1) 2+2*2=>6
    2) (2+2)*2=>8
    3) "Leo"+20+20=>Leo2020
    4) 20+20+"Leo"=>40Leo
    5) "Leo"+(10+20)=>Leo30
ShortHandOperators:
    Allow us to perform operations by writing less code.
    int num=2;
    num+=10;
    it means add 10 to the previous value of num which is 2 10+2=>12
    +=, -= , /= ,*= %= ,++, --
    ++ means increase the value of a variable by 1
Examples:
    1) int num=10;
    num+=10; =>20
    2) double num=20;
    num-=5; => 15
    3) float num=11F;
    num/=2; =>5.5
    4) int number=13;
    number%=4;=> 1
    5) int num=0;
    num++; => 1
    6) double num=0;
    num--; =>-1





Note:
    1) TO rename something we should use the refactor feature from intellij. It
    automatically renames everything. Right click and then select the refactor feature.
