if-else:
    we have a condition based on that condition we perform some tasks.
Why should we learn about if-else conditions:
    With the help of if else conditions we can write programs which can take decisions
    based on conditions.
Syntax:
    if(condition){
    // code that we want to execute once the conditions is true
    }

we can use any data type to write this condition part with the help of
relational operators(== != > < >= <=). Once the condition is true java executes all of the
code that we write inside the {}.
Logical operators:
    Logical operators help us combine multiple conditions. There are 3 main
    types of logical operators AND(&&) OR (||) NOT !. These operators only
    work with boolean datatype
Why we should use logical operators:
    they help us simplify the logic.
